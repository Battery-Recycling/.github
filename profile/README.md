# ⚡ Battery Materials Recovery Research & Automation

Welcome to the organization!
We build open-source tools that accelerate battery-materials recycling, Self-Driving Labs (SDL), and active learning for data-driven materials discovery.

## Mission

Our goal is to create transparent, reproducible, and high-impact software that helps researchers:

- Build computational thermodyanmics methods for battery black mass solutions
- Design and operate self-driving experimental workflows
- Model and optimize battery-recycling processes
- Build autonomous active-learning loops for experiments
- Apply ML and automation to complex materials-science problems

## Focus Areas

### Battery Recycling
- Process-modeling and simulation tools
- Material separation and recovery workflows
- Data engineering for experimental and characterization pipelines

### Self-Driving Labs
- Automation frameworks for closed-loop experimentation
- Orchestration tools for hardware, robotics, and ML models
- Interfaces for lab control, experiment scheduling, and data capture

### Active Learning
- Autonomous experiment–model loops
- Query strategies for expensive measurements
- Benchmark tools for evaluating decision policies
